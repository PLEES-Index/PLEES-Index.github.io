            <h2>The idea:</h2><br>
            <p>Paris Climate agreement was signed by 195 countries in 2015. The country
			leaders engaged to develop policies and actions in order to limit the rise in mean
			global temperature to below 2°C above pre-industrial temperature, with a target
			goal of 1.5°C. Recently, the Working Group 3 from the IPCC (Intergovernmental 
			Panel on Climate Change) released <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009325844">the third and last report</a> on the impacts
			of climate change, adaptation and vulnerability of countries, revealing that
			Paris agreement’s initial target of 1.5°C increase was unreachable. While 2°C
			target is still possible, they call for a urge to act before it is too late.<br><br>
			With the aim to raise awareness among the groups of people yet unaware of the
			urgency to act against climate change, we constructed an index called the PLEES
			index, based on the hierarchy of needs developed by Malsow. This index takes
			into account the psychological, social, and economical impact of climate change
			worldwide and can be projected under different scenarios of climate change.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>So, how can we act?</h2><br>
            <p>Malcolm Gladwell describes the social tipping point as “that magic moment
			when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads
			like wild- fire.” (<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55586972">Gladwell 2007</a>).
			The question one might ask is: how many people should be aware of climate change, 
			willing to take action and actually acting in order to reach this tipping point and 
			force governments into taking serious measures? There is no clear answer but our best 
			weapon as individuals is to bring people together to reach this tipping point as soon 
			as possible. Once reached, governments will be forced to take actions A recent article by 
			<a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1900577117">Otto et al (2020)</a> suggested that 
			achieving such kind of social dynamics could enable the decarbonization of our societies
			by 2050.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Our project:</h2><br>
            <p>This project aims to bring society a step closer towards the tipping point by diffusing 
			knowledge on the impact of human-induced climate change easily and understandably. To inspire 
			change we constructed the PLEES index inspired by Maslow’s pyramid of needs. Maslow argued 
			that people’s motivation is driven by five hierarchical levels of human needs and as more 
			basic ones are satisfied higher needs develop. The PLEES index considers the social, psychological, 
			and economic impact of climate change. We compute the index for the present day and the 
			expected value under different scenarios of climate change. Thus showing how people's needs 
			will change under different global emission scenarios graphically on <a href="map.html">the world map</a>. </p>
