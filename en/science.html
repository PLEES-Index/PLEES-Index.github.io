            <h2>The idea:</h2><br>
            <p>Paris Climate agreement was signed by 195 countries in 2015. The country
			leaders engaged to develop policies and actions in order to limit the rise in mean
			global temperature to below 2°C above pre-industrial temperature, with a target
			goal of 1.5°C. Recently, the Working Group 3 from the IPCC (Intergovernmental 
			Panel on Climate Change) released the third and last report on the impacts
			of climate change, adaptation and vulnerability of countries [1], revealing that
			Paris agreement’s initial target of 1.5°C increase was unreachable. While 2°C
			target is still possible, they call for a urge to act before it is too late.<br><br>
			With the aim to raise awareness among the groups of people yet unaware of the
			urgency to act against climate change, we constructed an index called the PLEES
			index, based on the hierarchy of needs developed by Malsow. This index takes
			into account the psychological, social, and economical impact of climate change
			worldwide and can be projected under different scenarios of climate change.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>So, how can we act?</h2><br>
            <p>Malcolm Gladwell describes the social tipping point as “that magic moment
			when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads
			like wild- fire.” [2] The question one might ask is: how many people should be
			aware of climate change, willing to take action and actually acting in order to
			reach this tipping point and force governments into taking serious measures?
			There is no clear answer but our best weapon as individuals is to bring people
			together to reach this tipping point as soon as possible1. Once reached, governments
			 will be forced to take actions A recent article [3] suggested that achieving
			such kind of social dynamics could enable the decarbonization of our societies
			by 2050.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Our project:</h2><br>
            <p>Our aim is to bring the society a step closer towards the tipping point. To this
			end we constructed the index M, inspired by the Maslow’s pyramid of needs.
			In the worldwide map we graphically show how this index, peoples needs, will
			change if the 2 degree goal is reached or if we do not act in time. The index M
			takes into account the social, psychological, and economical impact of climate
			change, inspired by the Maslow’s pyramid. Maslow argues that people’s motivation
			 is driven by five hierarchical levels of human needs. One starts at the
			 lowest level represented by physiological needs and, as these needs are satisfied,
			one moves up the pyramid to the highest level, where one aspires to develop
			personal satisfaction.As the most basic needs are satisfied higher needs develop.
			Our index shows at which stage, on the Maslow’s pyramid of needs, each country
			of the world is. We compute the index for present day and we project it under
			different scenarios of climate change (see Fig. 1).<br><br>
			The aim of our project is to diffuse knowledge on climate change, in an easy
			and understandable way, targeting rich European countries, showing that their
			life comfort is at risk. These countries have the financial capability and political
			influence to create global positive change. We aim to release the maps on social
			medias as well as carry out a communication campaign. We already presented
			our first results in a conference in France in June and got very positive and
			encouraging feedback. The timeline for our project is shown in Fig. 2.</p>
